## Global Constraints

- Repo root: `C:\Users\hhavens1\Desktop\austen-aloud` (shell commands below run from repo root; PowerShell syntax).
- The deployable site is `site/` only: **relative URLs only, no CDN/external requests, no frameworks** (portability to a UT server = folder copy).
- Site credit, verbatim: **"Hilary Havens and Gerard Cohen-Vrignaud"** (that order), on homepage and About page.
- Artwork credit, verbatim: **"Artwork by Maggie Stroud"**, linking to `https://maggiest.weebly.com/`.
- TEI texts and derived dataset are **CC BY-NC-SA 3.0**, attributed to *Austen Said* (principal Laura Mooneyham White), Center for Digital Research in the Humanities, University of Nebraska–Lincoln. Terry Weymouth's AustenDBBuilder/AustenAloud (CC0) credited as the foundation.
- Novel mapping (verified from the TEI): aus.001 Pride and Prejudice, aus.002 Persuasion, aus.003 Northanger Abbey, aus.004 Sense and Sensibility, aus.005 Emma, aus.006 Mansfield Park.
- Speaker attribution must never be conveyed by color alone; all images get alt text.
- Commit after every task (messages given per task).

## TEI facts the code below relies on (verified against aus.001)

- Namespace `http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0`; book id in `<TEI xml:id="aus.001">`.
- Title at `teiHeader//titleStmt/title[@type="main"]`.
- Speakers at `particDesc/listPerson/person[@xml:id]`, display name = joined text of `persName` parts (e.g. "Mrs. Bennet").
- Chapters: `div[@type="chapter"]` with `n`, `xml:id`, and `<head>Chapter 1. </head>`. In Emma (aus.005), `<head>` texts starting with `CHARADE` are content, not chapter labels (Terry's `HeadHandler` special case).
- Speech: `<said aloud="true|false" direct="true|false" who="aus.001.mrsb">…</said>`; narrator is `who="aus.00x.nar"`; `aloud` defaults to false when absent.
- `who` normalization (from Terry's `SaidHandler.normalize_speaker_id`): truncate at `_`; split multi-speaker ids on `;`; special case `aus.001.eli` → `aus.001.eliz`; anything else unknown → log and attribute to a synthetic `unknown` speaker.
- `<q>` wraps a conversation grouping; `<ref>` wraps an individual speech act (these feed `q_tags`/`ref_tags` in `book_stats`).
- `local_corrections.txt` is two human-readable notes about aus.001, not machine-applied rules — keep it in `builder/tei/` as documentation only.

### Task 9: README + release smoke check

**Files:**
- Create: `README.md`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the README**

`README.md`:
```markdown
# AustenAloud

Who speaks in Jane Austen's six novels — an interactive site built on the
*Austen Said* TEI editions, by Hilary Havens and Gerard Cohen-Vrignaud.

The `site/` folder is a fully static website (GitHub Pages–ready, portable
to any web server). The `builder/` folder is a Python pipeline that turns
the TEI files into `site/data/austen.sqlite` and the homepage summaries.

## Rebuilding the data

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python builder/fetch_tei.py        # needs `gh` with access to the source repo
python -m builder.build_db
python -m builder.export_summaries
python -m pytest
```

## Serving locally

```
python -m http.server 8080 --directory site
```

## Licensing

- Texts: *Austen Said* TEI editions (principal Laura Mooneyham White),
  Center for Digital Research in the Humanities, University of
  Nebraska–Lincoln — CC BY-NC-SA 3.0. This site and its derived dataset
  (`site/data/austen.sqlite`) carry the same license.
- Database architecture after Terry Weymouth's AustenDBBuilder (CC0).
- Artwork by Maggie Stroud, used with permission.
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run the full test suite**

Run: `python -m pytest -v`
Expected: all tests PASS.

- [ ] **Step 3: Browser smoke check (release gate)**

With the local server running, verify in Playwright:
1. Homepage: hero, byline "Hilary Havens and Gerard Cohen-Vrignaud", "Artwork by Maggie Stroud" link.
2. Six novel cards with charts; Elizabeth Bennet appears in Pride and Prejudice's top speakers.
3. Dialogue/narration chart with legend.
4. Explorer reaches "Pick a novel and a character." and draws a chapter chart.
5. About page: three credit items, `austen.sqlite` link returns 200.
6. 375px viewport: no horizontal page scroll (charts scroll inside their own containers).
7. Zero JS console errors.

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit**

```powershell
git add README.md && git commit -m "docs: README with build, serve, and licensing"
```
